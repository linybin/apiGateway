# apiGateway

The api-gateway-sdk generated by AWS will contain the utiility libraries together with applicaition-related codes. 
More specifically, the following files will be the same everytime you generate the sdk. 

```
    "src/lib/axios/dist/axios.standalone.js",
    "src/lib/CryptoJS/rollups/hmac-sha256.js",
    "src/lib/CryptoJS/rollups/sha256.js",
    "src/lib/CryptoJS/components/hmac.js",
    "src/lib/CryptoJS/components/enc-base64.js",
    "src/lib/url-template/url-template.js",
    "src/lib/apiGatewayCore/sigV4Client.js",
    "src/lib/apiGatewayCore/apiGatewayClient.js",
    "src/lib/apiGatewayCore/simpleHttpClient.js",
    "src/lib/apiGatewayCore/utils.js",
```

The repo will serve to concatenate and minimize the above codes and push it to the public bower registry. 

Because these files are generated by AWS, testing is not required. 

# How to use 
bower install apiGatewayJs

You need to include the apiClient.js in your application. aplClient.js is the only application-specific code generated by AWS.
